Since functions can come from many places other than</span><br /><span class="line">libraries, you need a method of permanently informing Click! as to what</span><br /><span class="line">their name is and where they reside.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">If you have functions which do not come from libraries, and you want</span><br /><span class="line">Click! to understand where they come from and include them in CLICK.DBF,</span><br /><span class="line">then add the file references to CLICKFNC.INI file following the example</span><br /><span class="line">of:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">&lt;function&gt; = &lt;LOCATION&gt;</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">like:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">swpruncmd=BLINKER.EXE</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">Everything in CLICKFNC.INI is included any time CLICK.DBF is created.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">Case is not sensitive and are corrected when the .INI file is read in.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">Improperly formatted lines are omitted.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">---</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">If you used the first word of a two word command as a function, then it</span><br /><span class="line">was treated wrong, like:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">MENU()</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">was coming out like:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">MENU ()</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">because of the MENU TO command.
