    <pre class="entry"><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Frequently Asked Questions PART I (F.A.Q.)</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  This section lists some common questions about PKZIP and related subjects.</span><br /><span class="line">  We hope you will find this information helpful.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Why do I get the message &#34;Bad Command or Filename&#34;?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  If you see this message, DOS is telling you it can&#39;t find the program you</span><br /><span class="line">  are referring to.  This can happen because you are either not spelling the</span><br /><span class="line">  name of the program properly, or you didn&#39;t put a space between the</span><br /><span class="line">  program name and its options, or the program is not in your path.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Please see the Installation section and your DOS manual for more</span><br /><span class="line">  information.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Why is this program so complicated?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  PKZIP initially was used to compress files that would be sent by modem.</span><br /><span class="line">  The people using PKZIP were mostly hobbyists with a fair amount of</span><br /><span class="line">  computer experience.  PKZIP was designed to be powerful and fast.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Someone who is familiar with the workings of PKZIP can be very efficient</span><br /><span class="line">  with the command line.  The command line interface is vital for automated</span><br /><span class="line">  or batch use of PKZIP.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Although PKZIP may seem very complex at first, it is easy to master if you</span><br /><span class="line">  take one step at a time.  Start simply by following the Tutorial, then</span><br /><span class="line">  experiment and build on that knowledge as you need more features.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Users who prefer using Graphical User Interfaces may wish to consider the</span><br /><span class="line">  &#34;PKZMENU&#34; product from PKWARE.  This easy to use menu-driven program</span><br /><span class="line">  offers PKZIP compatibility.  It features drop-down menus and a simple</span><br /><span class="line">  point and shoot interface.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Why didn&#39;t the files I Zipped get any smaller?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  On occasion, you may find that the files you add to a .ZIP file do not</span><br /><span class="line">  compress.  These files will be &#34;stored&#34;.  This will happen when a file is</span><br /><span class="line">  either already compressed or encrypted.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  In both cases the redundancy of the file will be gone, making compression</span><br /><span class="line">  difficult if not impossible.  If the file is encrypted you should first</span><br /><span class="line">  save it without encryption, and then use the encryption feature of PKZIP.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  You will often find that files distributed with commercial applications</span><br /><span class="line">  are already compressed.  A common example would be the graphic data files</span><br /><span class="line">  that come with games like Leisure Suit Larry or Ultima.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">I zipped up a bunch of files but now I have LESS disk space!?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  When PKZIP compresses files, it makes a copy of the original file.  The</span><br /><span class="line">  original file(s) are still present.  If you wish to recover space that was</span><br /><span class="line">  taken up by the original file(s), you must either delete them yourself, or</span><br /><span class="line">  instruct PKZIP to delete the file(s) with the -m option.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">What&#39;s the difference between -u and -f?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  The update and freshen options are very similar.  This may be confusing at</span><br /><span class="line">  first, but the difference between them is fairly easy to understand.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  The freshen option will tell PKZIP to archive any files which match those</span><br /><span class="line">  already in the .ZIP file.  These files will only be re-compressed if they</span><br /><span class="line">  are newer than the files already in the .ZIP file.  Each file is evaluated</span><br /><span class="line">  individually.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  The update option will archive all files, with one distinction.  If the -u</span><br /><span class="line">  is not used, all files specified will be compressed and added to the .ZIP</span><br /><span class="line">  file, even if they already exist in the .ZIP file.  By using the -u</span><br /><span class="line">  option, you instruct PKZIP to compare what is already in the .ZIP file</span><br /><span class="line">  against what it was asked to compress.  If a file is already present in</span><br /><span class="line">  the .ZIP file and is also in the source directory, PKZIP will compress a</span><br /><span class="line">  file only if it is newer than the copy of the file within the .ZIP file.</span><br /><span class="line">  If a file in the source directory is not already present in the target</span><br /><span class="line">  .ZIP file, PKZIP will add it to the .ZIP file.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Is PKZIP compression &#34;lossy&#34; or &#34;lossless&#34;?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  PKZIP uses a &#34;lossless&#34; compression scheme.  This means that 100% of the</span><br /><span class="line">  original data is preserved and re-created.  There is absolutely no</span><br /><span class="line">  difference between the data that you put in and the data which you get</span><br /><span class="line">  back out.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  There are other compression methods that are known as &#34;lossy&#34;.  The idea</span><br /><span class="line">  behind these compression methods is that if you throw away some of the</span><br /><span class="line">  data, it becomes less complex and therefore can be compressed more.  This</span><br /><span class="line">  type of compression is only useful for data that need not be precise.</span><br /><span class="line">  This applies to some applications that use pictures and sound.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">How do I zip up subdirectories?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  In order to ZIP up subdirectories you must both recurse subdirectories and</span><br /><span class="line">  preserve path names.  This is done with the -r and -p options in</span><br /><span class="line">  combination.  The options may be placed together as -rp.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  When a .ZIP file is created with paths stored, these paths will be visible</span><br /><span class="line">  in a view of the file (-v).</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  To re-create these subdirectories, or to place files into their original</span><br /><span class="line">  subdirectories, the -d option must be used with PKUNZIP.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Please see the tutorial for more information.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">I zipped up some subdirectories, but I can&#39;t get them to come back?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Did you remember to use the -p option in addition to the -r option? You</span><br /><span class="line">  may have stored files that are in subdirectories but not preserved the</span><br /><span class="line">  path names as part of the .ZIP file.  To check if there are paths in the</span><br /><span class="line">  .ZIP file, do a view of the file:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">     pkunzip file.zip -v</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  If you do not see paths as part of the file names within the .ZIP file,</span><br /><span class="line">  then paths were not stored and cannot be recovered.  If you do see paths</span><br /><span class="line">  all you need to do is use the -d (directory creation) option when you</span><br /><span class="line">  extract the files.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">How do I unzip a single file that is in a subdirectory in the .ZIP file?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Extracting a particular file from a .ZIP file is simple.  You type PKUNZIP</span><br /><span class="line">  with the name of the .ZIP file and the name of the particular file you</span><br /><span class="line">  want.  With a .ZIP file that contains paths the procedure is basically the</span><br /><span class="line">  same.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Let&#39;s assume a &#34;test&#34; .ZIP file with these files in it:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">     file1.txt</span><br /><span class="line">     apple\file2.txt</span><br /><span class="line">     apple\banana\file3.txt</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  To extract only &#34;file2.txt&#34; from this .ZIP file you must specify the</span><br /><span class="line">  complete name.  This would include the path.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">     pkunzip test.zip apple\file2.txt</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Note there is no leading slash.  This is how PKUNZIP differentiates</span><br /><span class="line">  between the files you are extracting with paths, and the target directory.</span><br /><span class="line">  &#34;file2.txt&#34; would be extracted to the current directory.  If you wanted to</span><br /><span class="line">  extract it with its subdirectory simply include the -d option on the</span><br /><span class="line">  command line.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">How do I unzip a directory without also extracting its subdirectories?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Using the above &#34;test&#34; .ZIP file we could extract the entire contents of</span><br /><span class="line">  the apple subdirectory easily:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">     pkunzip test.zip apple\*.* -d</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  If we did it as shown above we would not only extract all the files in the</span><br /><span class="line">  &#34;apple&#34; subdirectory, but also the &#34;banana&#34; subdirectory below it and any</span><br /><span class="line">  files it contains.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  To extract only the &#34;apple&#34; subdirectories contents, and nothing else, we</span><br /><span class="line">  must exclude those directories we do not wish to extract:</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">     pkunzip test.zip apple\*.* -d -xapple\banana\*.*</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  If the &#34;apple&#34; subdirectory had multiple subdirectories off it you would</span><br /><span class="line">  need to exclude each one individually on the command line.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">What is an AV?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  AV is short for &#34;Authenticity Verification&#34;.  AV is a process whereby a</span><br /><span class="line">  copy of PKZIP has unique codes and information contained in it identifying</span><br /><span class="line">  the owner of the copy of PKZIP.  This information is then encoded into a</span><br /><span class="line">  .ZIP file when it is created.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  When the file is extracted by PKUNZIP, this information is checked.  If</span><br /><span class="line">  the .ZIP file has been modified by a copy of PKZIP other than the one</span><br /><span class="line">  which initially created it, PKUNZIP will report that the file has been</span><br /><span class="line">  tampered with.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  The advantage of this feature is to offer a layer of protection between</span><br /><span class="line">  the creator of an archive and the recipient.  The recipient knows that the</span><br /><span class="line">  file received is the file that was sent, as well as being able to identify</span><br /><span class="line">  the creator if it is not known.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Where is my AV number?</span></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  As a licensed user of PKZIP you are entitled to one AV number.  In order</span><br /><span class="line">  to receive an AV number, you must apply for it.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  If you have a need to create AV encoded .ZIP files, fill out the form</span><br /><span class="line">  contained in the file &#34;authveri.frm&#34; found in your PKZIP archive.  Mail or</span><br /><span class="line">  fax this form to PKWARE.  Please allow up to four weeks for processing</span><br /><span class="line">  time, plus mail delays.  The codes needed to install your AV number will</span><br /><span class="line">  be returned to you via US Mail.  AV codes will not be returned by FAX,</span><br /><span class="line">  telephone, or any means other than US Mail.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  Please note that although the initial AV code is included with your</span><br /><span class="line">  purchase of a PKZIP license, changes or re-issues of an AV code may be at</span><br /><span class="line">  an additional cost.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">  You must apply for your AV number.  The serial number on the disk PKWARE</span><br /><span class="line">  sent to you has no relation to the AV number.  The AV number is based</span><br /><span class="line">  solely on the information you provide for your AV identification string on</span><br /><span class="line">  the AV application form.</span><br /></pre>
