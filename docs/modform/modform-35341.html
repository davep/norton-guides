An</span><br /><span class="line"> STS file is much the same as an STM file, except that the sound data for</span><br /><span class="line"> the instruments is not included in the file. Thus, in order to play an</span><br /><span class="line"> STS file, you would need all the sample disks that are used by that</span><br /><span class="line"> song (there are only certain instruments that can be used in STM/STS</span><br /><span class="line"> files, and they are all stored on numbered disks). Note that an STM file</span><br /><span class="line"> is called a module, and an STS file is called a song.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line"> This format was orginally used by the Screamtracker program on the Amiga,</span><br /><span class="line"> although other trackers can probably read these files as well. There is</span><br /><span class="line"> also a version of Screamtracker for the PC. The information supplied here</span><br /><span class="line"> comes from my experimentation with this PC version, and from the docs</span><br /><span class="line"> included with the program.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line"> <span class="ngu">James Holderness</span></span><br /></pre>
