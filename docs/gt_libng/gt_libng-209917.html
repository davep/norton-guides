    <pre class="entry"><span class="line">Background.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    Once upon a time (all good stories start like this), there was an idea.</span><br /><span class="line">    It was, for once, a good idea. And it was simple. The idea went something</span><br /><span class="line">    like this: Why not connect up a few bulletin boards and get them talking</span><br /><span class="line">    to each other and have them all sharing the same messages.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    Now this idea was simple: allow people to talk to each other, discuss</span><br /><span class="line">    clipper programming, clipper bugs, and many such other things.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    So one day, the Great Wizard decided he was going to do this, and so he</span><br /><span class="line">    did. He started up some message areas and slowly but surely they began</span><br /><span class="line">    to distribute themselves around the world.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    And thus, today, we have the Clipper echos. A few things have changed</span><br /><span class="line">    since then. There are 5 Clipper sponsored echos that originate from the</span><br /><span class="line">    First Independent Republic of Aberwhat&#39;sitsname. Each covering a specific</span><br /><span class="line">    sub-topic of Clipper.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    Access to these messages areas is free of charge, so there&#39;s no need</span><br /><span class="line">    to worry about having a bill charged to your credit card once a month.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    Some of these board are dedicated to Clipper and contain Clipper related</span><br /><span class="line">    file areas. Most of these files appear on these boards before appearing</span><br /><span class="line">    anywhere else. And the SysOp&#39;s are far more attentitive than other lesser</span><br /><span class="line">    spotted clones, where you have to wait a few days, if you&#39;re lucky, for</span><br /><span class="line">    requests to be carried out&lt;G&gt;.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">Nearly background, but not quite.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    This library was brought to you courtesy of the users of the GT Clipper</span><br /><span class="line">    echos. The users of the echos suggested that it might be a nice idea, if</span><br /><span class="line">    they had their own PUBLIC DOMAIN library. A few, had seen and used the</span><br /><span class="line">    NANFORUM Toolkit and had been impressed by the efforts of those who had</span><br /><span class="line">    contributed. The message went out for contributions to the library. Slowly,</span><br /><span class="line">    the files began to mount up and several revisions later, what you see here</span><br /><span class="line">    is the result.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">Guidelines for submitting code.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    One of the things decided early on was that we would not refuse any</span><br /><span class="line">    piece of code submitted to the library. There are no standards set for</span><br /><span class="line">    for what we will or will not accept. As long as authors acknowledge the</span><br /><span class="line">    fact that any code submitted is given free of charge and submitted to</span><br /><span class="line">    the PUBLIC DOMAIN.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    All pieces of code MUST follow a standard header format. This header is</span><br /><span class="line">    contained in the Norton Guides file, and all pieces of code contained in</span><br /><span class="line">    each version of the GT Clipper Library.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    We do not practise the art of Mickey taking over pieces of code submitted</span><br /><span class="line">    to the library. If a piece of code submitted contains PUBLIC or PRIVATE</span><br /><span class="line">    variables, we will shudder a bit, and discuss the usage of these with the</span><br /><span class="line">    author. But on the whole, PUBLIC and PRIVATE variables are not considered</span><br /><span class="line">    standard practise for the Library.</span><br /><span class="line"></span><br /><span class="line">    For more information and exact layout, please refer to the Norton Guide</span><br /></pre>
