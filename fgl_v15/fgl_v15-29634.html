After registering you will receive a complete version.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="ngb">About pictures.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In version 1.5 of Ferns&#39; Graphics Library it is possible to include images</span><br><span class="line">in your applications.</span><br><span class="line">The only format you can use is the BMP format.</span><br><span class="line">If you would also want to see another file format (TIFF,TGA,PCX,GIF or even</span><br><span class="line">JPEG) just register and descibe your ideas on the back of the</span><br><span class="line">registration form :-).</span><br><span class="line">There are two functions for BMP images :</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">With the function FGLLoadBmp() you can load an BMP image into an</span><br><span class="line">array which can be displayed by FGLPutBackground(). The internal</span><br><span class="line">representation of an image is different in 16/256/32k and 64k color mode.</span><br><span class="line">So if you load an image, be sure that you load it when you are in the</span><br><span class="line">same graphics mode as the one in which you want to display the buffer.</span><br><span class="line">You are advised not to change the contents of the array. But all the same :</span><br><span class="line">the first element contains the width of the image, the second contains the</span><br><span class="line">height. The following [height] elements all contain information for one</span><br><span class="line">scanline.</span><br><span class="line">To release the pointer to the array returned by FGLLoadBmp(), just assign</span><br><span class="line">NIL to it.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The second function, FGLShowBmp(), is included especially for large images</span><br><span class="line">which are displayed only once.</span><br><span class="line">If you want to display an 1024x768 image in 256 colors, you don&#39;t want to</span><br><span class="line">load this image into an array (that would require at least 768kB and a lot</span><br><span class="line">of time and effort !).</span><br><span class="line">With FGLShowBmp() you can display the image directly to the screen, without</span><br><span class="line">using 768 kB of VMM.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">If you load an image which is stored in more colors than the current color</span><br><span class="line">mode (for instance, an 24 bits picture in 256 color mode), for</span><br><span class="line">every pixel the closest match in the current palette is found.</span><br><span class="line">This method is, of course, dead-slow. If you don&#39;t have an optimal palette,</span><br><span class="line">it also mostly gives poor results.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">There are two methods to load/display your images in 16 and 256 color mode.</span><br><span class="line">Method one is with a free palette. With this option, the palette of the</span><br><span class="line">image you load will be loaded instead of the current palette. This often</span><br><span class="line">means with 256 color images that all the colors on your screen will change.</span><br><span class="line">This is because different images use different palettes.</span><br><span class="line">If you have never worked with palettes, look at the demo program to see what</span><br><span class="line">happens.  Almost all graphical libraries only have this option.  Unlike other</span><br><span class="line">libraries, Ferns&#39; Graphics Library offers an alternative to loading a palette</span><br><span class="line">and (probably) changing everything that&#39;s on your screen. With Ferns&#39; Graphics</span><br><span class="line">Library, you have the option to load your images with a fixed palette. When a</span><br><span class="line">image is loaded, every color in the image is mapped on the current palette (it</span><br><span class="line">finds the closest match).  This means that your current screen isn&#39;t changed</span><br><span class="line">and you can load as many images with different palettes as you like ! If you</span><br><span class="line">have a near optimal palette (like the standard palette of Ferns&#39; Graphics</span><br><span class="line">Library), the results will almost always be satisfactory.  See the demo</span><br><span class="line">program to see the difference.</span><br></pre>
