Read the chapter &#34;Using Data Encryption&#34;</span><br><span class="line">     2. Try to remember the password.</span><br><span class="line">     3. Try passwords that are &#34;close&#34; to what you think it was.</span><br><span class="line">     4. Try mixed upper and lower case versions of your password.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  There really is nothing that can be done if you lose or forget your</span><br><span class="line">  password.  Don&#39;t forget or lose your passwords! PKWARE has no special</span><br><span class="line">  means for &#34;getting around&#34; the encryption and may not be able to assist in</span><br><span class="line">  the recovery of an encrypted file.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗</span><br><span class="line">    ║ YOU SHOULD KEEP A WRITTEN COPY OF YOUR PASSWORD(S) IN A SECURE ║</span><br><span class="line">    ║ PLACE.  DO NOT TRUST YOUR MEMORY ALONE.                        ║</span><br><span class="line">    ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">What does &#34;Don&#39;t Know How to Handle&#34; mean?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  There are many different methods of compression.  In the history of PKZIP</span><br><span class="line">  alone there have been seven different methods to date.  The .ZIP file</span><br><span class="line">  format was designed so that additional methods of compression can be added</span><br><span class="line">  as they are developed.  In this way the .ZIP file format will never need</span><br><span class="line">  to be abandoned.  If you attempt to extract a .ZIP file that was created</span><br><span class="line">  with version 2.0 or higher with a lower version of PKUNZIP you will</span><br><span class="line">  receive the message &#34;Don&#39;t Know How to Handle&#34; for every file compressed</span><br><span class="line">  with a more advanced algorithm.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  If you attempt to extract a .ZIP file created with a version of PKZIP that</span><br><span class="line">  includes a method PKZIP 2.0 does not use, you will receive a warning that</span><br><span class="line">  will tell you what version of PKUNZIP you need.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">What is a CRC and why did it fail?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  CRC is short for Cyclic Redundancy Check.  A CRC is a value computed to</span><br><span class="line">  represent the data content of a file.  The CRC is computed by PKZIP when</span><br><span class="line">  it archives the file, and computed a second time when the file is</span><br><span class="line">  extracted.  If the second CRC does not match the first CRC, then a change</span><br><span class="line">  has occurred in the data.  The cause of a CRC failure can vary.  Here are</span><br><span class="line">  some possible causes for CRC failures.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  I.  Failure on the machine that created the .ZIP file.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    A.  Failure immediately after creation.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      1.  On a 386/486 or higher there may be an obsolete or poorly written</span><br><span class="line">          TSR or device driver interfering with PK(UN)ZIP.  Use the -3</span><br><span class="line">          option with both PKZIP and PKUNZIP to see if this is the problem.</span><br><span class="line">          Consult the Trouble Shooting section for more information.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      2.  &#34;Clean boot&#34; your machine.  Either re-name your autoexec.bat and</span><br><span class="line">          config.sys files so that they are not loaded, or insert a DOS boot</span><br><span class="line">          floppy and reset your machine.  Attempt extraction and compression</span><br><span class="line">          of the file again.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      3.  The floppy/hard disk controller may be failing.  See if there is</span><br><span class="line">          any difference in behavior if you compress to/from the hard disk</span><br><span class="line">          or floppy drive.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      4.  Failing diskette media.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      5.  A bad memory chip.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      6.  Your computer is suffering from the &#34;cache flaw&#34;.  This is caused</span><br><span class="line">          by problems with the external CPU cache on your computer&#39;s</span><br><span class="line">          motherboard.  See the Trouble Shooting section, -( option.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    B.  Failure after a period of time.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      1.  Any the above causes.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      2.  The file has been damaged during the time it was stored on the</span><br><span class="line">          hard disk.  The can be caused by cross-linking or &#34;lost&#34; clusters.</span><br><span class="line">          Some faulty disk-defragmenters and deletion recovery programs may</span><br><span class="line">          cause this.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      3.  Deleting and then undeleting a .ZIP file.  &#34;Undelete&#34; programs are</span><br><span class="line">          by no means flawless.  An undeleted or recovered file is very</span><br><span class="line">          likely to fail, as most disk recovery programs are imperfect at</span><br><span class="line">          best.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  II. Failure on a network server.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    A.  Some network server software does not run properly on 386/486</span><br><span class="line">        machines.  If PKZIP is used on the server CPU running this faulty</span><br><span class="line">        network software, it will be interfered with by the network</span><br><span class="line">        software.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  III. Failure after transfer of a file by modem.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    A.  Any of the problems cited in section I may be the cause of a</span><br><span class="line">        failure.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    B.  There was an error in the transfer of the file.  Use an &#34;error-</span><br><span class="line">        correcting&#34; protocol such as ZMODEM to avoid these types of</span><br><span class="line">        problems.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    C.  The file was transferred with &#34;Kermit&#34;.  If you use Kermit you must</span><br><span class="line">        set it to Binary mode.  PKZIP files are binary.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    D.  One of the computers or modems involved in the transfer has a</span><br><span class="line">        problem.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  IV. Failure after transfer by disk.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    A.  Any of the problems cited in section I may be the cause of a</span><br><span class="line">        failure.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    B.  Faulty disk controller/floppy drive.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    C.  Faulty floppy disk.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      1.  The drive alignment between the two computers may be off enough to</span><br><span class="line">          cause a data error.  Normally you will get a &#34;disk failure&#34;</span><br><span class="line">          message from DOS.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      2.  The disk was damaged by a magnetic or heat source.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      3.  The disk media is worn out or defective.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">What do &#34;Bad Table&#34; and &#34;Inconsistent Local Header&#34; mean?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  If you receive either or both of the above messages, the .ZIP file is</span><br><span class="line">  damaged or has been tampered with.  These messages may also be accompanied</span><br><span class="line">  by a CRC failure.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  All of the physical causes listed for CRC failures apply as possible</span><br><span class="line">  causes of these errors.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">How can I make PKZIP run faster?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  PKZIP defaults to a compression method that is average in both compression</span><br><span class="line">  amount and speed.  If you want to get the most speed out of PKZIP there</span><br><span class="line">  are several things you can do:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    1.  Specify a faster compression method with the -ef or -es option.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    2.  Use a large RAM disk as your temporary files drive.</span><br><span class="line">        PKTMP=(RAM disk drive letter)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    3.  If you are creating the .ZIP file on a network drive, set your PKTMP</span><br><span class="line">        equal to a drive on the same server.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    4.  Make as much conventional memory available as possible.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">How many files can be in a .ZIP file?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  A .ZIP file may contain a maximum of 16,383 file entries under MS-DOS.</span><br><span class="line">  Due to memory limitations this limit cannot actually be realized.  Under</span><br><span class="line">  the current memory scheme of DOS the largest number of files which may be</span><br><span class="line">  in a .ZIP file is approximately 9000 files.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  The maximum number of files you can handle with a .ZIP file operation can</span><br><span class="line">  be calculated by the following formulas:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">With No EMS or UMB&#39;s available:</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">     (Free Conventional RAM - 375k) / 64 bytes = Maximum # of Files</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">With EMS available:</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">     (Free Conventional RAM - 85k) / 64 bytes = Maximum # of Files</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  The &#34;Super Fast&#34; algorithm uses 32k less RAM than the other methods in</span><br><span class="line">  PKZIP 2.  You will be able to compress an additional 500 files when using</span><br><span class="line">  the &#34;Super Fast&#34; method.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Note that the value of 64 bytes per file is approximate and may vary.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  When a .ZIP file is being updated, you must not only take into account the</span><br><span class="line">  files being added, but allow 70 bytes per file in the original .ZIP file.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">Can I send a .ZIP file to a different type of computer?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  As of the publication of this manual, PKWARE currently supports PKZIP on</span><br><span class="line">  MS-DOS and OS/2 platforms, PKWARE intends to support additional platforms</span><br><span class="line">  and will announce these as they become available.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Because PKWARE has dedicated the .ZIP file format to the public domain, it</span><br><span class="line">  is possible for other people to write programs which can read .ZIP files.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">   ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗</span><br><span class="line">   ║ NOTE THAT THE PKZIP, PKUNZIP, PKSFX PROGRAMS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED     ║</span><br><span class="line">   ║ SOURCE CODE AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS ARE THE EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OF PKWARE ║</span><br><span class="line">   ║ INC.

A .ZIP file can be transferred to any platform for</span><br><span class="line">  which you can find a compatible extraction program.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Extraction and Compression programs not developed by PKWARE may not be</span><br><span class="line">  completely compatible with the .ZIP file standard.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Contact PKWARE for a list of platforms for which PKZIP and PKZIP</span><br><span class="line">  compatible software is available.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">What is the difference between -b and pktmp?</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  PKZIP creates two different types of temporary files, and allows you to</span><br><span class="line">  specify the location for these two types separately.  The two situations</span><br><span class="line">  where PKZIP creates temp files are:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">     * When a file is being added to a .ZIP file.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">     * When a .ZIP file is being modified.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  It is advantageous to have the temporary files for the first instance</span><br><span class="line">  written on the fastest drive on your system, unless you are creating a</span><br><span class="line">  .ZIP file on a Novell Network.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  The location for the temporary .ZIP file created when a .ZIP file is</span><br><span class="line">  modified is normally the same as the location of the original file.  In</span><br><span class="line">  some cases you may not have enough room on that drive.
