Either the target directory is full</span><br><span class="line">  or the file already exists and is read-only or locked by another</span><br><span class="line">  application.  On a Network you may receive this message if you do not have</span><br><span class="line">  file creation rights in the directory.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">PKZIP: (E[2,3]) XXXXX.ZIP - error in ZIP, use PKZIPFIX.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  The named .ZIP file has a corrupted file index.  Use PKZIPFIX to attempt</span><br><span class="line">  reconstruction of the .ZIP file.  In some cases the damage to the .ZIP</span><br><span class="line">  file may be very extensive.  If the file is too badly damaged PKZIPFIX</span><br><span class="line">  will not be able to recover the file.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  NOTE: Many novice users receive this message because of improper command</span><br><span class="line">  line syntax.  If you specify a command line with only one file name</span><br><span class="line">  following PKZIP and it is NOT a .ZIP file you will receive this message.</span><br><span class="line">  PKZIP assumes that the file is a .ZIP file because you specified it as the</span><br><span class="line">  first file name on the command line, and it attempts to place all files</span><br><span class="line">  from the current directory into that file.  Upon examination of the file</span><br><span class="line">  it will not find any .ZIP file information (due to its not being a .ZIP</span><br><span class="line">  file) and will then report this message.  Please see the tutorial for</span><br><span class="line">  further information.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">PKZIP: (E[4-11]) Insufficient memory.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Insufficient memory is available to process the .ZIP file.  Try making</span><br><span class="line">  more memory available to PKZIP.  If this does not rectify the problem then</span><br><span class="line">  the .ZIP file might be corrupted and PKZIPFIX should be used to fix the</span><br><span class="line">  .ZIP file.  If you are creating a new .ZIP file and receive this message,</span><br><span class="line">  it is due to an attempt to ZIP a large number of files.  Reduce the scope</span><br><span class="line">  of your command and try again.  If you are using a LIST file in your PKZIP</span><br><span class="line">  command you may be receiving this error because the LIST file is too</span><br><span class="line">  large.  See &#34;List Files&#34; for more information.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="ngb">PKZIP: (E12) No file(s) found.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  No matching files were found to list using the View option.
