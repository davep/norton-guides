    <pre class="entry"><span class="line"><span class="ngb"> Math Library (Floating Point) Routine compatibility</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> The Summer &#39;87 and Clipper 5 versions of Clipper both use the MSC</span><br><span class="line">         Alternate Math routines for Floating Point Routines.  These</span><br><span class="line"> routines were chosen because they were faster than the Emulator</span><br><span class="line"> routines in the MSC 5.x products.   This is the reason you must</span><br><span class="line"> compile all C modules with the /FPa (Floating Point alternate)</span><br><span class="line"> switch.  If your code calls any run-time library routines you must</span><br><span class="line"> link in the MSC library LLIBCA.  This library supports the large</span><br><span class="line"> memory model and includes the alternate floating point support</span><br><span class="line"> routines.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> Because of the differences in the design and implementation of the</span><br><span class="line"> alternate floating point routines between vendors, only Microsoft C</span><br><span class="line"> supports the use C floating point routines with Clipper.</span><br><span class="line"> This causes incompatibilities to arise between the floating point</span><br><span class="line"> routines intrinsic in Clipper and those that would be brought in by</span><br><span class="line"> any non-Microsoft library.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> <span class="ngb">Library routines that access the Math Library</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> The library routines that automatically call floating point</span><br><span class="line"> routines are as follows.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    Math routines</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      Obviously the math library routines use the floating point</span><br><span class="line">      math support routines. Also,   any use of the float or</span><br><span class="line">      double variable types will cause the inclusion of the</span><br><span class="line">      floating point routines.  Less obvious are the functions</span><br><span class="line">      that can accept these variable types as   parameters (such</span><br><span class="line">      as printf which could be passed a float or a double.) They</span><br><span class="line">      can also   cause the math routines to be included.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    Graphics Library routines</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">      Most of the graphics drawing routines use floating point</span><br><span class="line">      routines to determine the   position of the pixels along a</span><br><span class="line">      line or arc.  The basic routines for getting or setting the</span><br><span class="line">      video mode, changing video pages, or changing cursor</span><br><span class="line">      positions do not use floating   point.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> <span class="ngb">Library Routines in General</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> The best way to ensure your C code will be compatible with Clipper is</span><br><span class="line"> to avoid the use of the run-time library routines all together.  Many</span><br><span class="line"> times the use of a library routine could be avoided all together, if</span><br><span class="line"> it was thought to be important.  Many of these routines (low level</span><br><span class="line"> file I/O for example) can be easily implemented using DOS or BIOS</span><br><span class="line"> interrupt calls.  The best situation is one where you do not have to</span><br><span class="line"> link in the C run-time library at all.    While this is not always</span><br><span class="line"> possible, it is worth being aware of.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> If you are linking with a C library, be sure to list the Clipper</span><br><span class="line"> libraries on the link line first.  This is important because the</span><br><span class="line"> automatic search request that RTLink performs to find the Clipper</span><br><span class="line"> libraries is performed AFTER libraries on the link line are searched.</span><br><span class="line"> This means you may accidently replace some of Clipper&#39;s low level</span><br><span class="line"> functions with versions from the C library - which may not be</span><br><span class="line"> compatible.  The linker command line RTLINK FI Foo LIB LLIBCA the</span><br><span class="line"> linker will search LLIBCA.LIB  before CLIPPER.LIB,  but the line</span><br><span class="line"> RTLINK FI Foo LIB CLIPPER, EXTEND, TERMINAL, DBFNTX, LLIBCA  will</span><br><span class="line"> not.</span><br></pre>
