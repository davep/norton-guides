# Public Norton Guide Collection

## Introduction

This is my effort to collect and publish a collection of Norton Guide
database files. Included here will be files that I have a licence to
publish; so either guides that are in the public domain, have a permissive
licence, or where I might have managed to get explicit permission to
publish.

If you're looking for a guide that isn't here please keep the above in mind:
even though a lot of these files are decades old at this point, I'm not
inclined to publish something that I don't have a licence for.
