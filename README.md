# Public Norton Guide Collection

## Introduction

This is my effort to collect and publish a collection of Norton Guide
database files. Included here will be files that I have a licence to
publish; so either guides that are in the public domain, have a permissive
licence, or where I might have managed to get explicit permission to
publish.

I've listed all non-private guides I have access to [in the project's
wiki](https://github.com/davep/norton-guides/wiki), and in there I've made a
note of any copyright or licence status I've been able to work out. Any
guide where it is clear I can publish it is
[published](https://norton-guides.davep.dev) and marked as such in the
table.

If you're looking for a guide that isn't in this repository please keep the
above in mind: even though a lot of these files are decades old at this
point, I'm not inclined to publish something that I don't have a licence
for.

## Tools

This repository is built using [ng2web](https://ng2web.davep.dev), a tool [I
built to convert Norton Guide files into a
website](https://blog.davep.org/2025/03/24/ng2web.html) using a template
approach.

The site itself is generated using a [GitHib
workflow](.github/workflows/publish.yaml) and is hosted using GitHub Pages.
